 Basic Object Operations (1â€“10)
<!-- Create a simple object person with name, age, and country. -->

<!-- Access object values using dot and bracket notation. -->

<!-- Add a new key gender to an existing object. -->

<!-- Update the value of a key in an object. -->

<!-- Delete a key from an object. -->

<!-- Check if a key exists in an object using in operator. -->

<!-- Check if a key exists in an object using hasOwnProperty(). -->

<!-- Iterate over all keys in an object using for...in. -->

<!-- Count the number of properties in an object. -->

<!-- Create an object with keys as numbers and values as strings. -->

ðŸ”„ Dynamic Keys and Values (11â€“20)
<!-- Create an object with a dynamic key from a variable. -->

<!-- Create an object using a function that returns an object. -->

<!-- Clone an object using the spread operator { ...obj }. -->

<!-- Clone an object using Object.assign(). -->
